This is the final project for the Software Engineering Methods and Tools class. We are creating an app for national parks across Colorado.

We completed everything our proposal stated we would have including three models, users, parks, and microposts.

As an extra, we were able to add a background picture to our app and add a map to each of the parks to help users navigate when they're at the park.

We used Bootstrap in this application have tested it with Cucumber and Rspec.
