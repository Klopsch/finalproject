This is the final project for the Software Engineering Methods and Tools class. We are creating an app for national parks across Colorado.

As per our project proposal, we were able to complete:
A homepage with a list of the parks in the database
Park information sheet with a description and location as well as the newsfeed (microposts)
The microposts of current park information
A new post page
Creation of an account
Logging into an account
A user profile where you can view past parks you've visited
The ability to edit the profile and add other parks

We completed everything our proposal stated we would have including three models, users, parks, and microposts.

As for extras, we will be implementing a search functionality, the ability to rate the parks, and the ability to tag the catagories of the posts.

We used Bootstrap in this application and will continue to test it using Cucumber and Rspec.
